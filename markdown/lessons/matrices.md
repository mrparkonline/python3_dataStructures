# Matrices in Python 3
---

## What is a Matrix?

Mathematically, matrix is a representations of numbers, symbols, or expressions in a 2-Dimensional Array.

In Computer Science, especially with Python, we can start to create a data structure that has values in rows and columns, much like a table, by utilizing a list within a list. There are external libraries/modules that can be imported into your python program to help this process; however, we will be constructing them with just the standalone python version.

This is a fundamental concept in mathematics especially for Calculus, Vectors, and Linear Algebra.

For more information, you can read them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).

## Mathematical Matrix Diagram

![](./src/matrix_fig01.png)

This is a mathematical notation of what a matrix looks like; explanations are as follows:

```
Let A represent the matrix
Matrix A has m rows and n columns ... in this case 2 rows and 4 columns.

Row 1 has values of 1 2 3 4
Column 2 has values of 2 6
```

## Matrix A in Python 3


```python
# Python 3 Representation of matrix A

matrix_A = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8]
]

# Accessing Matrix A
print('Row 1: %s' % matrix_A[0]) # Recall: Indexing starts at zero in Python
print('Value at Row 2 Column 2: %s' % matrix_A[1][1])
```

    Row 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    Value at Row 2 Column 2: 6


```
In Python 3, there is no data structure called a "Matrix".

Therefore, we are programming a list within a list and following the rules of a regular matrix:
- All rows must have the same number of values
- All columns must have the same number of values
- All items in the 2D List must have the same data types
- Since indexing always starts at 0 ... row 1 is technically located at matrix_A[0]
```

# List Comprehension in Python 3
---

List Comprehension is a concise method to create list in Python 3.

This technique is commonly used when:
- The list is a result of some operations applied to all its items
- It is a made from another sequence/iterable data
- The list is member of another list/sequence/iterable data that satisfies a certain condition

_This is where the **lambda function** would be used, but… we will learn the other way for readability._
_We will definitely talk about lambda functions in our Functional Programming Unit_

## List Comprehension Example 1

We are to create a list which squares all the numbers from [0,10)


```python
# Old Method
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

print('Our result: %s' % squares)
```

    Our result: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]



```python
# List Comprehension

squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]

print('Our new result: %s' % squares)
```

    Our new result: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]


## How Does it Work?

List comprehension consists of:
- A **Square Bracket** containing an expression that describes the list
- One or more **For clause** to explain its members
- Then a zero or more **if clauses** depending on the complexity of the list

```
Examine: [i**2 for i in range(10)]

-- i**2 for i in range(10) --> is the expression that describe the list
-- i**2 describes each item in the list
-- i is taken from the for clause
-- for i in range(10) describes where i comes from
```

### List Comprehension Example 2

```
Create the list: [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 1], [2, 4], [3, 1], [3, 4]]
From 
A = [1,2,3]
B = [3,1,4]

By using list comprehension
```


```python
# Solution
a = [1,2,3]
b = [3,1,4]

result = [[x, y] for x in a for y in b if x != y]
print(result)
```

    [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 1], [2, 4], [3, 1], [3, 4]]


**Explanation:**
```
Each item of our list has to be a list of two values; therefore, each item is described as [x, y]

There are two for clauses because we are create a list from two sources
-- x comes from a
-- y comes from b

There is a condition to our item --> x != y
-- Therefore, as long as the condition x != y is true, we will add the item described as [x,y] to our resulting list
```

### List Comprehension Example 3
```
Use list comprehension to turn a 2D array called vec to a single list

vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```


```python
# Solution

vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

result = [value for row in vec for value in row]
print('Vec as a single list of values: %s' % result)
```

    Vec as a single list of values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


**Explanation**
```
Vec is an example of a matrix in Python 3 by using list of lists

To grab each value one by one from the rows we must do the following in order:
1. Explain what each item in the list comprehension is going to be ... in our case --> "value"
2. To now access where value is, define where it comes from ... in our case --> "row"; 
        therefore, for row in vec
3. Finally we construct our last for clause to denote that value comes from the row

With list comprehension, the order of your for clauses matter!
